# This blu3 - I work with Java and C#, am learning C and C++, and am writing my own language, Aperture. Nearly all of my projects are private.

# Currently working on:
 - Ravine, a 2d Java game engine framework with easy-to-use sprites and sounds (private until completion)
 - Director, a Java GUI framework fully compatible and easy to implement with pre-existing JFrames (private until completion)
 - An unnamed biome mod for Terraria, serves no purpose other than to learn C# (permanently private)
 - The Aperture Programming Language - object-oriented, fast to write, and allows for total control of memory management. (private until completion, name may change)
  - Syntax is completed
  - Compiler is in the works - ETA 1 year
